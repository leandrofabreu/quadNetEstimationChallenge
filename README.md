# quadNetEstimationChallenge

This repository maintain data generated by the quadrature network for the QuadNet Estimation Challenge.

# The Challenge!

The challenge here is to estimate the phase of all oscillator based in some (few) measured states.


# About QuadNet

QuadNet is a network composed by quadrature oscillators. The nonlinear model of the quadrature oscillator can be found in [this article]([https://www.genome.gov/](https://www.sba.org.br/open_journal_systems/index.php/sbai/article/view/3854)) (portuguese only).

# Data description

The data was generated by experiments described as below. In all experiments, the following variables were saved:
- `params`: list of parameters of each oscillator in the following order: `R1`, `R2`, `C1`, `C2`, `R3`, `C3`, `R4`, `R5`, `R6`, `R7`, `Vcc`, `Vd`, `Ra`, `Rb`, `R`, `Rf`
- `x`: array of states with shape (len(t), len(x0))
- `Rf`: parameter that defines the coupling strength
- `pc`: phase coherence, an order parameter that measure the degree of synchronization of whole network
- `pcMean`: time average of the phase coherence
- `pcStd`: standard deviation of the phase coherence

Parameters of all simulation:
- `h = .005`: integration time step (seconds)
- `tfTr = 60`: transient time (seconds)
- `tf = 120`: total time of the simulation in permanent regime (seconds)

## Exp001: two coupled oscillators

Two oscillators with natural frequencies 3.80 Hz and 4.00 Hz, coupled with many different coupling strengths (`Rf`). The plot below can be used as a guide to verify the level of synchronization for each `Rf`. It is worth to note that a null phase coherence, in this case, means anti-phase synchronization.
